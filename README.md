# Lab Name: Lab2 - Multivariate Linear Regression, Non-Parametric Models and Cross-Validation

## Lab Synopsis

This Lab uses Python and Jupyter Notebook in a VS Code environment to deal with a Scikit-Learn diabetes dataset. Split the three datasets into a train, validation, and test set to calculate multivariate linear regression, non-parametric models, and cross-validation algorithm models. These algorithm models help with subsequent data analysis, then a visualization presentation of the table and graph.

## Data Source: 

1. diabetes dataset: Scikit-Learn provides toy diabetes dataset.
